# Simple DCA Bot Configuration
# Dollar Cost Averaging for a single subnet

# === Wallet Configuration ===
wallet: "default"  # Your Bittensor wallet name
validator: "your_validator_hotkey_ss58_here"  # Replace with your validator's hotkey SS58 address

# === Target Subnet ===
target_netuid: 1  # The subnet you want to DCA into (change this to your desired subnet)

# === DCA Strategy Settings ===
purchase_amount: 0.01  # Fixed TAO amount to buy each interval
interval_seconds: 5    # How often to buy (in seconds)
min_balance: 0.5       # Stop buying when wallet balance hits this threshold (in TAO)
max_price_threshold: 0.05  # Only buy if alpha price is at or below this value (in TAO)

# ===================================================================
# CONFIGURATION NOTES:
# ===================================================================
# 
# 1. REPLACE 'your_validator_hotkey_ss58_here' with your actual validator hotkey
# 
# 2. TARGET SUBNET: Set 'target_netuid' to the subnet you want to DCA into
#    Popular subnets:
#    - 1: Text Prompting subnet
#    - 3: Conversational AI subnet  
#    - 5: Open Kaito subnet
#    - 7: Mining subnet
#    - 9: Pretraining subnet
#    - 11: Writing subnet
# 
# 3. PURCHASE AMOUNT: Start with small amounts like 0.01-0.1 TAO for testing
# 
# 4. INTERVAL: 5 minutes is a good starting point. You can adjust based on:
#    - Network activity
#    - Your risk tolerance  
#    - Available time to monitor
# 
# 5. MIN BALANCE: Keep enough TAO for network fees and other operations
#    Recommended: 0.5-1.0 TAO minimum balance
#
# 6. MAX PRICE THRESHOLD: Only buy when alpha price is at or below this value
#    - Set to 0.0 to disable price filtering (buy at any price)
#    - Recommended: Research historical prices and set reasonable threshold
# 
# ===================================================================
# EXAMPLE SETTINGS FOR DIFFERENT STRATEGIES:
# ===================================================================
# 
# Conservative DCA (price-sensitive):
# purchase_amount: 0.01
# interval_minutes: 15
# min_balance: 1.0
# max_price_threshold: 0.03  # Only buy below 0.03 TAO
# 
# Aggressive DCA (higher price tolerance):
# purchase_amount: 0.1  
# interval_minutes: 3
# min_balance: 0.5
# max_price_threshold: 0.08  # Buy up to 0.08 TAO
# 
# Value Hunter DCA (strict price limits):
# purchase_amount: 0.05
# interval_minutes: 30
# min_balance: 2.0
# max_price_threshold: 0.025  # Only buy very cheap alpha
#
# No Price Filter (time-based only):
# max_price_threshold: 0.0  # Disabled - buy at any price
